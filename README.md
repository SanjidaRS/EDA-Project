Welcome to the EDA Projects Repository! This repository contains various Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) projects that analyze different datasets to uncover insights, patterns, and relationships. 
Each project is organized in its own directory and includes code, visualizations, and detailed documentation.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a crucial step in the data analysis process that involves summarizing the main characteristics of a dataset, often using visual methods. 
This repository aims to showcase different techniques and methodologies for performing EDA across a variety of datasets and domains.
This `README.md` provides a clear and organized description of the repository, making it easy for users to understand the structure and navigate through different EDA projects.
